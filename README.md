8. BMI Calculator
Create a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their BMI. Then, perform the BMI calculation based on the input values and display the result on the webpage. Additionally, consider including features such as different unit options (metric or imperial) and providing a BMI classification based on the calculated value.
